Studying Vanilla JavaScript

## introduction

js is everywhere
browser, mobile, servers etc
mpodern js with ecmascript
nodejs development to run js on server or other engine
browser's war --> optimizing js constantly
--> we will see JS as a front end language/tool

weird facts about js
--> asynchronous nature
--> event loop

we will need an html page
some styling with css
and some life with js
ES6 --> supported by many browsers
also babel for backwards compatibility

tools
--> web browser, go for chrome it's pretty good
--> VS Code as a code editor
--> Live Server plugin
--> F12 to inspect the web page, you can rip apart the page of the console so that it does not take space in one monitor, instead of having it together with the page
