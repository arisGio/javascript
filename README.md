# javascript

Studying Vanilla JavaScript

## introduction

js is everywhere
browser, mobile, servers etc
mpodern js with ecmascript
nodejs development to run js on server or other engine
browser's war --> optimizing js constantly
--> we will see JS as a front end language/tool

weird facts about js
--> asynchronous nature
--> event loop

we will need an html page
some styling with css
and some life with js
ES6 --> supported by many browsers
also babel for backwards compatibility

tools
--> web browser, go for chrome it's pretty good
--> VS Code as a code editor
--> Live Server plugin
--> F12 to inspect the web page, you can rip apart the page of the console so that it does not take space in one monitor, instead of having it together with the page

js can print in the console but can print to other places too

we some introductory things
we saw how to set up our environment
etc

## identifiers

we saw how to simply print to the console
how to comment out
how to set up our environment
--> now let's talk about variables-identifiers
they are simply locations in memory kept during our program is executing

## arrays

main.js is our main file

other than push() there are many other usefull array methods that we will see later on...

## strings

asdf

## objects

JSON
JSON.stringify

## for loops

for in loop

for of loop

## while, do while, logical operators

conditions
logical operators
while loop
do while loop

## if & switch

if
switch --> when we have many conditions

## operators

numerical operators
pre-increment
post-increment
comparison operators
non strict & strict comparison operators
assignment operators
typeof
destructuring operator
spread operator
map object values

## delete, ternaries, break, continue

delete in objects
'key' in object
delete in arrays
very rare to delete from array
more common to delete from object
delete is an operator way to delete an element
arrays also have methods like splice where you can manipulate them instead of using operators
conditional operator
jump operators -> break, continue

## functions

block
scope
function definition
function invokation
function parameters
default values for function parameters
return value
anonymous functions
arrow functions aka fat arrow functions

## browser side

dom: document object model
document object
CSS selectors
querySelector()
querySelectorAll()
alert()
addEventListener()
thus with JavaScript we can query events and elements

## scope

JS is event-based
JS is asynchronous
different scope & contect with other languages
scope: view we have on a variable
context: has to do with the 'this' keyword
var | let | const
you can debug through the console directly

## context, this

context: main source of bugs, juniors get messed up
this keyword with button example
event based nature of JavaScript
fat arrow functions

## array methods 1/3

filter, map, reduce, sort
