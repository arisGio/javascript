# javascript

Studying Vanilla JavaScript

## introduction

js is everywhere
browser, mobile, servers etc
mpodern js with ecmascript
nodejs development to run js on server or other engine
browser's war --> optimizing js constantly
--> we will see JS as a front end language/tool

weird facts about js
--> asynchronous nature
--> event loop

we will need an html page
some styling with css
and some life with js
ES6 --> supported by many browsers
also babel for backwards compatibility

tools
--> web browser, go for chrome it's pretty good
--> VS Code as a code editor
--> Live Server plugin
--> F12 to inspect the web page, you can rip apart the page of the console so that it does not take space in one monitor, instead of having it together with the page

js can print in the console but can print to other places too

we some introductory things
we saw how to set up our environment
etc

## identifiers

we saw how to simply print to the console
how to comment out
how to set up our environment
--> now let's talk about variables-identifiers
they are simply locations in memory kept during our program is executing

## arrays

main.js is our main file

other than push() there are many other usefull array methods that we will see later on...
